\title{Logistic function}
\usage{
logistic(x, slope = 1, midpoint = 0, upper = 1)

sigmoid(x, slope = 1, midpoint = 0, upper = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Value at which to evaluate the function}

\item{slope}{Slope of logistic function at the midpoint. Defaults to 1.}

\item{midpoint}{Midpoint of logistic function where the output is \code{upper/2}. Defaults to 0.}

\item{upper}{Upper asymptote (maximal value) of the logistic function. Defaults to 1.}
}
\value{
Numeric value given by \deqn{f(x) = \frac{upper}{1 + e^{-slope \cdot (x - midpoint)}}}
}
\description{
Computes the logistic (i.e., sigmoid) function with configurable slope, midpoint, and upper asymptote.
}
\details{
The logistic function is a smooth S-shaped curve bounded between 0 and \code{upper}.
It transitions from near 0 to near \code{upper} around the \code{midpoint}, with the steepness
of this transition controlled by \code{slope}.
}
\examples{
logistic(0)
# equivalent:
sigmoid(0)
logistic(1, slope = 5, midpoint = 0.5, upper = 10)

# Visualize different slopes
x <- seq(-5, 5, length.out = 1000)
plot(x, logistic(x, slope = 1), type = "l", ylab = "f(x)", ylim = c(0, 1))
lines(x, logistic(x, slope = 5), col = "blue")
lines(x, logistic(x, slope = 50), col = "red")
legend("topleft", legend = c("slope = 1", "slope = 5", "slope = 50"),
       col = c("black", "blue", "red"), lty = 1)
