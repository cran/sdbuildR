\title{Start Julia and activate environment}
\usage{
use_julia(stop = FALSE, force = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{stop}{If TRUE, stop active Julia session. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{force}{If TRUE, force Julia setup to execute again.}
}
\value{
Returns \code{NULL} invisibly, used for side effects
}
\description{
Start Julia session and activate Julia environment to simulate stock-and-flow models. To do so, Julia needs to be installed and findable from within R. See \href{https://kcevers.github.io/sdbuildR/articles/julia-setup.html}{this vignette} for guidance. In addition, the Julia environment specifically for sdbuildR needs to have been instantiated. This can be set up with \code{install_julia_env()}.
}
\details{
Julia supports running stock-and-flow models with units as well as ensemble simulations (see \code{ensemble()}).

In every R session, \code{use_julia()} needs to be run once (which is done automatically in \code{simulate()}), which can take around 30-60 seconds.
