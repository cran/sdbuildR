ensemble(
  sfm,
  n = 10,
  return_sims = FALSE,
  range = NULL,
  cross = TRUE,
  quantiles = c(0.025, 0.975),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{sfm}{Stock-and-flow model, object of class \code{\link[=xmile]{sdbuildR_xmile}}.}

\item{n}{Number of simulations to run in the ensemble. When range is specified, n defines the number of simulations to run per condition. If each condition only needs to be run once, set n = 1. Defaults to 10.}

\item{return_sims}{If TRUE, return the individual simulations in the ensemble. Set to FALSE to save memory. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{range}{A named list specifying parameter ranges for ensemble conditions. Names must correspond to existing stock or constant variable names in the model. Each list element should be a numeric vector of values to test.

If cross = TRUE (default), all combinations of values are generated. For example, list(param1 = c(1, 2), param2 = c(10, 20)) creates 4 conditions: (1,10), (1,20), (2,10), (2,20).

If cross = FALSE, values are paired element-wise, requiring all vectors to have equal length. For example, list(param1 = c(1, 2, 3), param2 = c(10, 20, 30)) creates 3 conditions: (1,10), (2,20), (3,30).
Defaults to NULL (no parameter variation).}

\item{cross}{If TRUE, cross the parameters in the range list to generate all possible combinations of parameters. Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{quantiles}{Quantiles to calculate in the summary, e.g. c(0.025, 0.975).}

\item{only_stocks}{If TRUE, only return stocks in output, discarding flows and auxiliaries. If FALSE, flows and auxiliaries are saved, which slows down the simulation. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{keep_nonnegative_flow}{If TRUE, keeps original non-negativity setting of flows. Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{keep_nonnegative_stock}{If TRUE, keeps original non-negativity setting of stocks Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{keep_unit}{If TRUE, keeps units of variables. Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{verbose}{If TRUE, print details and duration of simulation. Defaults to TRUE.}
}
\value{
Object of class \code{\link[=ensemble]{sdbuildR_ensemble}}, which is a list containing:
\describe{
\item{success}{If TRUE, simulation was successful. If FALSE, simulation failed.}
\item{error_message}{If success is FALSE, contains the error message.}
\item{df}{data.frame with simulation results in long format, if return_sims is TRUE. The iteration number is indicated by column "i". If range was specified, the condition is indicated by column "j".}
\item{summary}{data.frame with summary statistics of the ensemble, including quantiles specified in quantiles. If range was specified, summary statistics are calculated for each condition (j) in the ensemble.}
\item{n}{Number of simulations run in the ensemble (per condition j if range is specified).}
\item{n_total}{Total number of simulations run in the ensemble (across all conditions if range is specified).}
\item{n_conditions}{Total number of conditions.}
\item{conditions}{data.frame with the conditions used in the ensemble, if range is specified.}
\item{init}{List with df (if return_sims = TRUE) and summary, containing data.frame with the initial values of the stocks used in the ensemble.}
\item{constants}{List with df (if return_sims = TRUE) and summary, containing data.frame with the constant parameters used in the ensemble.}
\item{script}{Julia script used for the ensemble simulation.}
\item{duration}{Duration of the simulation in seconds.}
\item{...}{Other parameters passed to ensemble}
}
}
\description{
Run an ensemble simulation of a stock-and-flow model, varying initial conditions and/or parameters in the range specified in \code{range}. The ensemble can be run in parallel using multiple threads by first setting \code{\link[=use_threads]{use_threads()}}. The results are returned as a data.frame with summary statistics and optionally individual simulations.
}
\details{
To run large simulations, it is recommended to limit the output size by saving fewer values. To create a reproducible ensemble simulation, set a seed using \code{\link[=sim_specs]{sim_specs()}}.

If you do not see any variation within a condition of the ensemble (i.e. the confidence bands are virtually non-existent), there are likely no random elements in your model. Without these, there can be no variability in the model. Try specifying a random initial condition or adding randomness to other model elements.
